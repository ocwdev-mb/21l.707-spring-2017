## Course Description

“In some fundamental sense \[reading cookbooks\] taught me about active reading, about reading for the ideas at the edge of a narrative as well as those in the centre. It showed me that books can mean more than they intend. It started me looking for the importance embedded in the apparently trivial and unregarded, the things a culture takes for granted.”   
– Nicola Humble, *Culinary Pleasures: Cookbooks and the Transformation of British Food*

“The extent to which we take everyday objects for granted is the precise extent to which they govern and inform our lives.”   
– Margaret Visser, *Much Depends on Dinner*

Iron chefs and home cooks; molecular gastronomy and farm-to-table dining; grain-based and protein-based diets: a time traveler from the future would learn a lot about us from our cookbooks, blogs, and Food Network. When we visit the past through cookbooks, we too learn about the worlds that produced such strange and quirky dishes as Tartes of Flesh and Gooseberry Fools. We learn about what foodstuffs and technologies were available and when; about how religious and nutritional concerns dictated what was eaten and how it was cooked; about who was doing the cooking and who was writing the recipes; about the gender dynamics of culinary writing and performances.

## Primary Sources

Obviously, we can’t read all the following cookbooks cover to cover, so we’ll be focusing, rather, on selected chapters and recipes. All the books, except for the 20th-21st century ones, are available online, in reprints, and/or in free ebook editions.
