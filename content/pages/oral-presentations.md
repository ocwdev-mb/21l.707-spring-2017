You will each have the opportunity to introduce the class to one of the cookbooks we’ll be studying this term. Familiarize yourself with the cookbook and select a typical recipe or two. Then, in a presentation of no more than 15 minutes, highlight what you find distinctive about your chosen recipe(s). Consider any/all of the following:

*   Prefatory material: Preface, Introduction, “To the Reader,” etc.
*   Arrangement of material
*   Tone & style
*   What sort of ingredients are called for? Consider, e.g. geographic origins, seasonality, cost, nutritional and/or religious concerns, taste/flavor profile
*   What sort of culinary techniques: boiling, roasting, baking, grilling, etc.?
*   What kitchen equipment would be needed to prepare the dish?
*   What was the available heat source?
*   Anything else you may find relevant
*   Optional (but much appreciated): try preparing one of the recipes and share it in class

You must show an outline of your presentation the day before you present and submit a hard copy of the outline on the day of the presentation. Please provide enough copies of your recipe(s) for the class. Your presentation will be graded and you will receive a written evaluation.
